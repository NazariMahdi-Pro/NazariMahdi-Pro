## 🚀 About Me
I’m a computer science student and a passionate self-taught developer.  
I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively, whether it’s a **terminal-based tool**, a **fancy UI web app**, or even experimenting with **Android development**.  

- 🐍 Writing Python code is my daily bread.  
- 🌐 Exploring JavaScript and building modern web apps.  
- 📱 Learning Android to dive deeper into mobile app development.  
- 🎨 Strong focus on **user experience** and design in every project.  
- 🤝 Open to collaboration, teamwork, and contributing to open-source projects.  

I believe in **learning by building** — every project I create is not just a tool, but also a way to learn something new.
